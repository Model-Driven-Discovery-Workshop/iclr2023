# Call for Papers

This workshop responds to a growing need for broad, boundary-spanning collaborations between ML and non-ML disciplines. To this end, submissions this workshop will seed the development of such a community by bringing experts together around data and mechanistic models describing the infection process of two widespread viruses impacting two different systems of the human body (COVID-19 and Human Papillomavirus). 

Valid workshop submissions must be based on results generated with these two models, and must use the source code provided [here-in]. You are free to use additional models/data. The code is written in Python, however tools like Reticulate can be used to import into R (or whatever environment the authors prefer). The common resource is an important element of the work and it captures the standard problem formulation(s). You are free to extend the environments with Wrappers to provide the input/output which are relevant for your results. You can also generate datasets with the Python environments, and then save and process them using tools of your choice.
