# Call for Papers

This workshop responds to a growing need for broad, boundary-spanning collaborations between ML and non-ML disciplines. To this end, submissions this workshop will seed the development of such a community by bringing experts together around data and mechanistic models describing the infection process of two widespread viruses impacting two different systems of the human body ([COVID-19](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/covasim/en/latest/index.html) and [Human Papillomavirus](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/hpvsim/en/latest/index.html)). 

Valid workshop submissions must be based on results generated with these two models, and must use the source code provided [here-in](https://github.com/IBM/ushiriki-policy-engine-library). You are free to use additional models/data. The code is written in Python, however tools like [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) can be used to import into R (or whatever environment the authors prefer). The common resource is an important element of the work and it captures the standard problem formulation(s). You are free to extend the environments with Wrappers to provide the input/output which are relevant for your results. You can also generate datasets with the Python environments, and then save and process them using tools of your choice. 

Relevant topics for the workshop are completely up to the imagination and interests of the authors. For instance, models and data could be used to understand the drivers of historical disease patterns, to forecast future disease patterns in human populations, or to consider unobserved counterfactual scenarios. Alternatively, results from existing scholarship can be generated from the provided models, and contrasted to highlight or verify any findings. There is no restriction placed on the nature of the research submitted to this workshop using these models.

All workshop submissions are to be 3-5 page manuscripts in PDF format.

All valid submissions will be invited to submit the following two files: a 10 minute video presentation ([.mp4 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP4_file_format)) and captions encoded in [VTT format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API). These captions can be automatically generated using tools like webex, zoom, and slack. All content submitted should be validated for accuracy as automatic captioning is still in its infancy. 

The committee will make efforts to translate English language captions into French, and French language captions into English. Six submissions will be selected to be presented during the 1/2 day workshop with live Question & Answers by representatives of the author team.
